# Fake-product-review-monitoring-system

1. To identify the spam user using positive and negative reviews in online social media
2. To display only trusted reviews in online social media.
3. The proposed framework is to model a Amazon review dataset as a heterogeneous Information Network(HIN) classification problem.
4. Based on observations, defining two views for features (rewiew-user and behavioral-linguistic), the classified features as review behavioral have more weights and yield better performance on spotting spam reviews in both semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches.
5. Categorizing features in four major categories (review-behavioral, user-behavioral, review-linguistic, user-linguistic), helps us to understand how much each cateogry of features is contributed to spam detection.
